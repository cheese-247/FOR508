evidence of execution and prefetch 
prefetch is to speed up laoding of applicationa and is not designed as a security artifact (dna is not designed to catch murders but that is how it is used)
doesnt record delete or upload just interacitons and frequently ran items to preload items. 

C:\Windows\Prefetch is the locaton 
C:\Windows\Prefetch
system 32 is where the 64bit applicatoins are 
syswow64 (system windows 32bbit on 64 bit windows) is where the 32bit applicaitons are at 

with prefetch the first time you run executable it makes the file unless it ahs been deleted. Prefetch can show the first time it was run unless it was previously deleted. 
also timing prefetch and its ten seconds versus the time the applicagion took tog et running 

last execution timestamp is accurate, shows up to 8 other run times per application. if 7 shows 7 if 10 only shows last 8 first 2 would be lost. 
also refrenced files and directories will be shown. 

shimcache if you execute a file, modify file, or scroll through and browse over the icon. ALl of these create a shim event. NOT GURANTEED EVIDENCE OF EXECUTION BUT IF EXECUTED IT WILL MAKE A SHIMCACHE.
best practice is to compare with prefetch as if truly executed both will populate. 
just the m timestamp that from shimcache only changes when you modify the file. 
Windows XP simcache had guratneed exection proof
windows 8,10,11 no guranteed evidence of exection via simchache. 

C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs|Amcache.hve 

svchost should only run out of system32 folder typically
