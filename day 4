job is to scope 
patient zero 
how bad is it 

sigcheck with sysinternals 
can check for entropy which is the randomness odd to see in system32 files in windows shouldnt really see it score should be 6-8 with sigcheck

maldump will check and extract quarantince files (could be extracting live malware and could accedntially excute again)

MACB
M time stamp is the contents of the file 
A Data last accessed 
C is the metadata filename time etc
B file creation time IE BORN birthday 

M and A more important 

if file is copied technically a new file M timestamp is the only one that wint change. 

set up a share on the target system (net use or smb) to drop malware on target system 

files must have M and B stamps lab 4.2 stun.exe missing M and B 

stun.exe missing thoses on this snapshot has been there before or its been timestomped to give it the apperance of being there. like a teenager getting a fake ID

smartscreen is when a file is downloaded from the internet attached to edgeupdater makes a ADS

shellbags 
.lnk files are evidence of opening files 

smcache is the last modified time of a file 
so a bunch of files with the same time is a renamed file 

when you download a file form the internet you are modifying it technically cause a new file is made while it all pulls down 

prefetch means that something was pulled to be ran 
only last 8 instances of command be ran even if it was 25 times just last 8
